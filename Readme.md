## Data Structures and Algorithms

This project records my experimentation with various data structures and algorithms. Implementation of data structures which have not been provided as part of the Standard Template Library (STL) by the C++ standard have been designed, example Trie, Binary Search Tree. A few of the data structures have been implemented in different way like linked lists. In addition to it, numerous problems, whose efficient solution employs these data structures have been attempted. Implementation of well known algorithms in the C++ language using the STL has been provided.

The problems have been picked from [Elements of Programming Interview][1] and [GeeksForGeeks][2]. The implementation accounts for approaches and suggestions mentioned in the above references.
